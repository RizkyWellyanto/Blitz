        About us & terms and conditions<br>
        <br>
        Blitz is a project made by a few college students aimed to improve the lives of others by providing an open
        platform for critiquing, discussing ideas and exchanging strategies for writing English essays and to preform
        well in literature classes. We strive to stimulate our fellow classmates’ motivation to write better essays and
        to practice the art of critical thinking.<br>
